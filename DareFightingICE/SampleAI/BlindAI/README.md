# Deep Reinforcement Learning Blind AI

This page contains the source code and model of our deep reinforcement learning blind AI (Blind AI), the details of which are given in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07444).

## Installation:
- Install miniconda for python 3.8: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/FightingICE`.
- Create and activate conda env:
  
    ```
    cd DareFightingICE/DareFightingICE/SampleAI/BlindAI
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate ice
    ```

- Boot DareFightingICE with the option `--limithp 400 400 --grpc-auto --non-delay 0`.
- Run the ```train.py``` file to train. e.g ```python train.py --p2 MctsAi23i --encoder mel --id rnn_1_frame_256_mctsai23i --n_frame 1 --recurrent```
- Run the ```trained_ai/test.py``` to test the Blind AI. e.g. ```python trained_ai/test.py --p2 MctsAi23i --encoder mel```

## File Description
- ```train.py``` is a file used to train Blind AI. Please run ```python train.py -h``` for our explanation of the parameters.
- ```train_ai``` folder contains source code for the trained AI which is used as a sample AI for the AI track. It uses the FFT audio encoder and GRU. All weights are stored in ```trained_model```.
- ```visualize.py``` is used to visualize the learning curve and calculate the area under the learning curve.
- ```analyze_fight_result.py``` is used to calculate the win ratio and average HP difference between Blind AI and MctsAi65.

## Get sound design evaluation metrics
- After finishing your sound design, please run the following command to train Blind AI:
  ```python train.py --p2 MctsAi65 --encoder fft --id {experiment_id} --n_frame 1 --recurrent```, where you can decide ```experiment_id``` on your own
- After training, a result file with the name ```result_fft_{experiment_id}_rnn.txt``` is created. Please run ```visualize.py``` as follows: ```python visualize.py --file result_fft_{experiment_id}_rnn.txt --title FFT```. A plot will be shown and the area under the learning curve will be printed out.
- Before testing the performance of the Blind AI against MctsAI65, please remove all the files under ```log/point``` of DareFightingICE.
- Please revise the ```path``` parameter of the Blind AI in line 16 of ```trained_ai/test.py``` to your trained model location.
- Run ```python trained_ai/test.py --p2 MctsAi65 --encoder fft``` to begin testing.
- After testing, please run ```python analyze_fight_result.py --path {path}``` where ```path``` is the location of ```log/point``` of DareFightingICE.
- Both win ratio and average HP difference will be printed out.
