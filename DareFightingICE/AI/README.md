### What is the DareFightingICE LLM AI Competition:
----
In this competition, you are tasked with making an LLM AI that plays game in DareFightingICE platform. You will be provided with the interface that allows access to frame data and a sample AI. **Click the image below to watch our promotional video.**

### Instruction on how to run the platform:
---
1. Download DareFightingICE from this [link](https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/FightingICE/releases) along with the resource files given in a note. (latest version 7.1).
3. Extract the downloaded file and run the appropriated script for your OS (e.g. `run-linux-amd64.sh` for Linux).
4. Once the game screen opens, move to "Launch" with the arrow keys and press "Z" button.
5. Follow the instruction in this [link](https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/Generative-Sound-AI) on how to run Generative Sound AI. This step is necessary because the sounds generated by this AI will be used by the game-playing AI.
6. Follow the instruction in this [link](https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/pyftg/tree/master/examples) on how to run Python AI.
7. Move to "Play" with the arrow keys and press "Z" button to start the fight.

### What To Submit:
---
For submission, please create a zip file containing:

- Prompt and/or
- Finetuned model upload onto HuggingFace.
- The source code you are allowed to modify.

Please also attach a PowerPoint (or OpenOffice) file describing the following information:

- The sample AI implemented using Python is available [here](https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/pyftg/tree/master/examples).

### Rules:
---
__General Information__

One game has three rounds. The maximum fighting time of a round is 60s. After one round, the character's positions and HPs will be reset, and a new round is started. All games in the competition are conducted with the options "--limithp 400 400" (limit HP of both players to be 400) of DareFightingICE. The FrameData sent to AIs will have a delay of 15 frames.

Your AI will be made publicly available and by submitting you will have agreed to this.

Each team can submit only one entry.

Participants **must not** submit a previous year’s entry **without modification**.

__LLM__
- You may use LLMs with up to 7B parameters. Any model exceeding this limit will result in disqualification.

__Multi-threading__
- You are allowed to utilize multi-threading up to 16 threads (CPU) and employ any GPU computation library.

__File I/O__
- Attempts to read or write files in any other directory than your AI's will lead to disqualification.
- You are allowed to submit up to 64GB, including source code and data (AI model, etc...).

__The "Small Print"__
- We, the organizers of this competition, will do our utmost to ensure the competition is running smoothly and fairly. All our decisions are final.
- We expect participants to uphold the spirit of the competition. Any attempts to cheat will lead to immediate disqualification without appeal. Attempts to cheat include:
- trying to disturbing opponent's controller
- trying to circumvent the competition's security framework
- memory scanning
- trying to corrupt the file system
- trying to disrupt the ongoing competition in any way
- intentionally loosing games or creating specific game states on purpose
- We reserve the right to alter these rules at any time without notice.
If you have any questions or suggestions or encounter any problems, please email us and we will try to address the issue as quickly as possible.
We have made every effort to comply with copyright law. If you should have copyright concerns, please contact us.

The above rules are based on the Ms Pac-Man vs Ghosts League 2012 Competition.

### Evaluation:
---
Two leagues (Standard and Style) in this competition are described as follows:
The Standard League considers the winner of a round as the one with the HP above zero at the time its opponent's HP has reached zero. Both AIs will be given the initial HP of 400. The league for a given character type is conducted in a round-robin fashion with two games for any pair of entry AIs switching P1 and P2. The AI with highest number of winning rounds becomes the league winner; If necessary, remaining HPs are used for breaking ties. In this league, our weakened sample MctsAi with limited to 23 iterations per frame, played in the non-blind mode or with FrameData, and our [sample LLM AI](https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/FightingLLM) will also be participating as baseline AIs. **ZEN** will be used in this league.

In the Style League, each entry competes against our MctsAi while adhering to a specified fighting style. Two styles are evaluated: RushDown and Zoning. For each style and each entry, five games are played with the entry AI as P1 and MctsAi as P2, followed by another five games with the roles reversed. Both AIs start with an initial HP of 400. In addition to overall performance, compliance with the designated fighting style is also assessed. **NEZ** is used as the Zoning benchmark, while **GARNET** serves as the RushDown benchmark.

The ranking rules are as follows:
The ranking rules are defined as follows. In the Standard League, AIs are ranked based on the number of winning rounds. In the Style League, both the number of winning rounds and the fighting-style score are considered. If ties occur, the total remaining HP is used as the tiebreaker. After rankings are determined for each league, league points are awarded according to finishing positions using **[the 2018 Formula-1 scoring system ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship#Scoring_system)**. The overall competition winner is determined by the sum of league points across the two leagues.
