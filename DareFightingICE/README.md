## <div align="center"><b>A fighting game competition for promoting the sound design of fighting games, targeting visually impaired players</b></div>

Welcome to the DareFightingICE Competition. This competition is our way of including the mostly ignored group of players when it comes to video games. You are invited to develop an AI and/or design a sound design for Java-based DareFightingICE, FightingICE with an enhanced sound design. FightingICE itself had been successfully used in a fighting game AI competition conducted in 2013, from 2014 to 2021 as an official competition at IEEE CIG/CoG. There are two tracks. The first track is an AI competition using the sound-input-only version of FightingICE. The second track is a sound-design competition.
