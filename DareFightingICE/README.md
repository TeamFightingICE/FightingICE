## <div align="center"><b>A fighting game competition for promoting the sound design of fighting games, targeting visually impaired players</b></div>

Welcome to the <b>DareFightingICE Competition</b>. This competition is our way of including the mostly ignored group of players when it comes to video games. You are invited to develop an AI and/or design a sound design for Java-based DareFightingICE, FightingICE with an enhanced sound design. FightingICE itself had been successfully used in a fighting game AI competition launched in 2013 and from 2014 to 2021 as an official competition at IEEE CIG/CoG. From 2022, there are two tracks. The first track is an AI competition, and the second track is a sound-design competition.
