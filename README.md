# FightingICE #

This repository is a repository for the development of the 2D fighting game FightingICE, which is used in international competitions for fighting game AI performance.<br>

### About FightingICE ###
FightingICE is a 2D fighting game used in the Fighting Game AI Competition (FTGAIC), an international competition that competes for the performance of fighting game AI certified by Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG).

### How to start development ###
- Clone the project into your local workspace.
- Download resources required for development from [here](https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/FightingICE/releases/download/v6.1/resources-6.1.zip) and extract into the root directory.
- Add all libraries from `lib` into your project. (for LWJGL, please add only one native match with your OS)
