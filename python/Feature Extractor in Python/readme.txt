This class:

-Is meant to help in extracting features from the JSON logs generated by the FightingICE as well as from the py4j stub objects.
-Can be used to:extract single features, for a more flexible usage
  --extract feature in bulk repeatedly, for a more structured usage
  --Provides access to all the raw features stored in the JSON and some additional features that require some computation (e.g., distance of closest threat): these latter features are recognizable by the '()' at the end of their name.
  --Provides information on the features possible values (e.g., range for numerical features, possible values for enums, whether None could be returned, etc.), useful when features need to be normalized or one-hotted.
